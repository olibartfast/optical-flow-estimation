# Optical Flow Estimation 

This project focuses on the [Optical Flow computer vision task](https://paperswithcode.com/task/optical-flow-estimation), specifically testing various libraries and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models using C++.

The initial focus is on implementing and testing the [RAFT](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT) model (Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms).
